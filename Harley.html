        <p>Harley-Davidson, Inc. (H-D), or Harley, is an American motorcycle manufacturer, founded in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in 1903.<br>

One of two major American motorcycle manufacturers to survive the Great Depression (along with Indian),<br> the company has survived numerous ownership arrangements, subsidiary arrangements (e.g., Aermacchi 1974-1978 and Buell 1987-2009),<br> periods of poor economic health and product quality, as well as intense global competition,<br> to become one of the world's largest motorcycle manufacturers and an iconic brand widely known for its loyal following.<br> There are owner clubs and events worldwide as well as a company-sponsored brand-focused museum.<br>

Noted for a style of customization that gave rise to the chopper motorcycle style,<br> Harley-Davidson traditionally marketed heavyweight,<br> air-cooled cruiser motorcycles with engine displacements greater than 700 cm³ and has broadened its offerings to include<br> its more contemporary VRSC (2002) and middle-weight Street (2015) platforms.

Harley-Davidson manufactures its<br> motorcycles at factories in York, Pennsylvania; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Kansas City, Missouri; Manaus, Brazil; and Bawal, India,<br> and markets its products worldwide.

Besides motorcycles, the company licenses and markets merchandise under the Harley-Davidson brand,<br> among them apparel, home decor and ornaments, accessories, toys,<br> and scale figures of its motorcycles, and video games based on its motorcycle line and the community.</p>
