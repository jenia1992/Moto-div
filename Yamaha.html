        <h1>Yamaha</h1>
        <p>Yamaha was established in 1887 as a piano and reed organ manufacturer by Torakusu Yamaha as in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka prefecture and was incorporated on October 12, 1897.<br> The company's origins as a musical instrument manufacturer are still reflected today in the group's logo—a trio of interlocking tuning forks.

After World War II,<br> company president Genichi Kawakami repurposed the remains of the company's war-time production machinery and the company's expertise in metallurgical technologies<br> to the manufacture of motorcycles. The YA-1 (AKA Akatombo, the "Red Dragonfly"), of which 125 were built in the first year of production (1954),<br> was named in honour of the founder. It was a 125cc, single cylinder, two-stroke, street bike patterned after the German DKW RT125<br> (which the British munitions firm, BSA, had also copied in the post-war era and manufactured as the Bantam and Harley-Davidson as the Hummer).<br> In 1955, the success of the YA-1 resulted in the founding of Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd.<br>

Yamaha has grown to become the world's largest manufacturer of musical instruments <br>(including pianos, "silent" pianos, drums, guitars, brass instruments, woodwinds, violins, violas, celli, and vibraphones),<br> as well as a leading manufacturer of semiconductors, audio/visual, computer related products, sporting goods, home appliances,<br> specialty metals and industrial robots.

In 1989, Yamaha shipped the world's first CD recorder.[chronology citation needed]<br> Yamaha purchased Sequential Circuits in 1988.It bought a majority stake (51%) of competitor Korg in 1987,<br> which was bought out by Korg in 1993.

In the late 1990s, Yamaha released a series of portable battery operated keyboards under the PSS and the PSR<br> range of keyboards. The Yamaha PSS-14 and PSS-15 keyboards were upgrades to the Yamaha PSS-7 and were notable for their short demo songs,<br> short selectable phrases, funny sound effects and distortion and crackly sounds progressing on many volume levels when battery power is low.

In 2002,<br> Yamaha closed down its archery product business that was started in 1959. Six archers in five different Olympic Games won gold medals using their products.<br>

It acquired German audio software manufacturers Steinberg in January 2005, from Pinnacle Systems.

In July, 2007,<br> Yamaha bought out the minority shareholding of the Kemble family in Yamaha-Kemble Music (UK) Ltd, Yamaha's UK <br>import and musical instrument and professional audio equipment sales arm, the company being renamed Yamaha Music U.K. Ltd in autumn 2007.<br> Kemble & Co. Ltd, the UK piano sales & manufacturing arm was unaffected.

On December 20, 2007,<br> Yamaha made an agreement with the Austrian Bank BAWAG P.S.K. Group BAWAG to purchase all the shares of Bösendorfer,<br> intended to take place in early 2008. Yamaha intends to continue manufacturing at the Bösendorfer facilities in Austria.<br> The acquisition of Bösendorfer was announced after the NAMM Show in Los Angeles, on January 28, 2008. As of February 1, 2008,<br> Bösendorfer Klavierfabrik GmbH operates as a subsidiary of Yamaha Corp.<br>

Yamaha Corporation is also widely known for their music teaching programme that began in the 1950s.<br>

Yamaha electronics have proven to be successful, popular and respected products. For example,<br> the Yamaha YPG-625 was awarded "Keyboard of the Year" and "Product of the Year" in 2007 <br>from The Music and Sound Retailer magazine. Other noteworthy Yamaha electronics include the SHS-10 Keytar,<br> a consumer-priced keytar which offered MIDI output features normally found on much more expensive keyboards.</p>
