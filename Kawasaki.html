        <h1>Kawasaki</h1>
        <p>Kawasaki Aircraft initially manufactured motorcycles under the Meguro name, having bought an ailing motorcycle manufacturer,<br> Meguro Manufacturing with whom they had been in partnership. This eventually became Kawasaki Motor Sales.<br> Some early motorcycles display an emblem with "Kawasaki Aircraft" on the fuel tank.

During 1962,<br> Kawasaki engineers were developing a four-stroke engine for small cars.<br> Then some of the engineers transferred to the Meguro factory to work on the Meguro K1 and the SG,<br> a single cylinder 250 cc OHV. In 1963, Kawasaki and Meguro merged to form Kawasaki Motorcycle Co.,Ltd.<br> Kawasaki motorcycles from 1962 through 1967 used an emblem which can be described as a flag within a wing.<br>

Work continued on the Meguro K1, a copy of the BSA A7 500 cc vertical twin.[5] and on the Kawasaki W1.<br> The K2 was exported to the U.S. for a test in response to the expanding American market for four-stroke motorcycles.<br> At first it was rejected for a lack of power. By the mid-1960s, Kawasaki was finally exporting a moderate number of motorcycles.<br> The Kawasaki H1 Mach III in 1968, along with several enduro-styled motorcycles to compete with Yamaha, Suzuki and Honda,<br> increased sales of Kawasaki units.

Kawasakiâ€™s engines division, housed in a single office complex in Grand Rapids, Michigan,<br> consolidates research and development projects for engines.</p>
